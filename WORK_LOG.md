| Dec 6 | 10am-10:30am | I am beginning to code the LZW algorithm, doing a linear pass and adding to the TST as I go. I finished coding the logic for looking up the prefix code if it exists, but I am still working on finding the longest prefix to check. |
| Dec 6 | 1:10-1:40pm  |                           I coded out the expansion algorithm, using the slides as a reference. I used a map of strings for each of my codes, and made sure to only add the first character of my lookahead string to my new prefix. |
